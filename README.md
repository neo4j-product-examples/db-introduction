## Prerequisites

There are two options for running the demos. The preferred approach is to use an AuraDB free account, in which you will be able to create database instances with the sample data sets already loaded. If you are using a standard AuraDB account, there is a limit of one Free instance at a time, so you will not be able to have all sample data sets available at once. Neo4j employees can request a special account that allows multiple Free instances.

The other option is to load the sample data into local databases running on Neo4j Desktop. This will allow you to have all of the databases available at once and will also allow demos where there is no connection to the Internet (provided of course, that you have already downloaded the required software and sample data first). A drawback to this option is that you will not be able to show Data Importer.

### AuraDB Option

For this option, simply log into your Aura account and create a Free instance. You can use any of the ptions that have sample data, but the StackOverflow, Recommendations, and Cybersecurity may resonate more.
